# How to install prerequisites for libhal

NOTE: that these prerequisites aren't the only way one can use and install
libhal, but these are most supported and recommended way of using libhal.

## Prerequisites

- `cmake`: 3.15 or above
- `conan`: 1.51.3 or above (conan 2.0.0+ not currently supported)

If you already have these installed you can skip this step.

NOTE: This section is not complete and a complete guide to installing g++-11
is not currently available. Still investigating the simplest way to achieve
this.

TODO(#429): Flesh out this section out

Download g++-11.3.0 from: https://winlibs.com/ and unzip it.
