<summary> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview </summary>
<hr/>

libembeddedhal is a collection of interfaces and abstractions for embedded
system peripherals and devices using modern C++ best practices. The goal is to
make writing embedded systems software & applications easy for everyone.

- Header only
- Dependencies:
  - Boost.LEAF for error handling
  - C++20 and above (currently only supports g++-10 and above)
- Target/platform agnostic (ARM Cortex, STM32, AVR, RPI, embedded linux, etc)
- Designed to be modular, dynamic, composable, lightweight
- Throwing exceptions out of drivers is strictly forbidden
- Dynamically allocating memory is forbidden (rare exceptions may exist for some
  libraries)
- Follows C++ Core Guidelines as much as possible
- Nearly no use of macros (currently only 1 macro)
- Customizable using tweak header files (not through macros)

<summary> üí° Motivation </summary>
<hr/>

The world of embedded systems is written almost entirely in C and C++. More and
more the embedded world moves away from C and towards C++. This has to do with
the many benefits of C++ such as type safety, compile time features,
meta-programming, multiple programming paradigms which, if use correctly can
result in smaller and higher performance code than in C.

But a problem for embedded software in C++, as well as in C, is that there isn't
a consistent and common API for embedded libraries. Looking around, you will
find that each vendor of embedded products has their own set of libraries and
tools for their specific products. If you write a driver on top of their
libraries, you will find that your code will only work for that specific
platform, using that specific API and in some cases using a specific toolchain.
You as the developer are locked in to this one specific setup. And if you move
to another platform, you must do the work of rewriting all of your code again.

libembeddedhal seeks to solve this issue by creating a set of generic interfaces
for embedded system concepts such as serial communication (UART), analog to
digital conversion (ADC), inertial measurement units (IMU), pulse width
modulation (PWM) and much more. The advantage of building a system on top of
libembeddedhal is that higher level drivers can be used with any target platform
whether it is an stm32, an nxp micro controller, runs on RISC-V or is on an
embedded linux.

This project is inspired by the work of Rust's embedded_hal and follows many of
the same design goals.

libembeddedhal's design goals:

1. Serve as a foundation for building an ecosystem of platform agnostic drivers.
2. Must abstract away device specific details like registers and bitmaps.
3. Must be generic across devices such that any platform can be supported.
4. Must be minimal for boosting performance and reducing size costs.
5. Must be composable such that higher level drivers can build on top of these.
6. Be accessible through package mangers so that developers can easily pick and
   choose which drivers they want to use.

<summary> üéõÔ∏è Customization </summary>
<hr/>

libembeddedhal uses the `tweak.hpp` header file approach to customization and
configuration. See [A New Approach to Build-Time Library
Configuration](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2020/10/04/lib-configuration.html).

```C++
#pragma once
#include <string_view>
namespace embed::config {
// Defaults to "test". Indicates that the current running platform is a
// unit/integration test. Change this to the target platform you are building
// for. For example, if you are targeting the LPC4078 chip, you should change
// this to "lpc4078".
constexpr std::string_view platform = "test";
// Defaults to "true". Enables stack tracing when errors do occur. There is a
// performance cost, albeit small, to capturing the current function name.
constexpr bool get_stacktrace_on_error = true;
// Defaults to "32". The maximum depth a stack trace can reach before it stops
// adding entries to the stack trace. Changing this effects the amount of space
// that the embed::stacktrace object takes up in a functions stack when used
// with Boost.LEAF.
constexpr size_t stacktrace_depth_limit = 32;
// Defaults to "false". If set to false, only the fully qualified function name
// will be stored in the stack trace. Set to true, the stack trace will capture
// the line number and file name into the stack trace object as well. Capturing
// the file names will increase the binary size of the application as the file
// name strings need to be stored in ROM.
constexpr bool get_source_position_on_error = false;
}  // namespace embed::config
```

Create a `libembeddedhal.tweak.hpp` file somewhere in your application and make
sure it is within one of the compiler's include paths. For GCC/Clang you'd use
the `-I` flag to specify directories where headers can be found. The file must
be at the root of the directory listed within the `-I` include path.

<summary> üìú Coding Policies </summary>
<hr/>

Listed below are the policies that every libembeddedhal implementation must
follow to ensure consistent behavior, performance and size cost:

<details>
<summary>Style</summary>

- Code shall follow libembeddedhal's `.clang-format` file, which uses the
  Mozilla C++ style format as a base with some adjustments.
- Code shall follow libembeddedhal's `.naming.style` file, which is very
  similar to the standard library naming convention:
  - CamelCase for template parameters.
  - CAP_CASE for macros.
  - lowercase snake_case for everything else.
  - prefix `p_` for function parameters.
  - prefix `m_` for private/protected class member.
- Refrain from variable names with abbreviations where it can be helped. `adc`
  `pwm` and `i2c` are extremely common so it is fine to leave them
  abbreviations. Most people know the abbreviations more than the words that
  make them up. But words `cnt` should be `count` and `cdl` and `cdh` should be
  written out as `clock_divider_low` and `clock_divider_high`. Registers do get
  a pass if they directly reflect the names in the data sheet which will make
  looking them up easier in the future.
- Use `#pragma once` as the include guard for headers.
- Every file must end with a newline character.
- Every line in a file must stay within a 80 character limit.
  - Exceptions to this rule are allowed. Use // NOLINT in these cases.
- Radix for bit manipulation:
  - Only use binary (`0b1000'0011`) or hex (`0x0FF0`) for bit manipulation.
  - Never use decimal or octal as this is harder to reasonable about for most
    programmers.
- Every public API must be documented with the doxygen style comments (CI will
  ensure that every public API is documented fully).
- Include the C++ header version of C headers such as `<cstdint>` vs
  `<stdint.h>`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Coding Restrictions</summary>

- Use the `libxbitset` library to perform bitwise operations operations.
- Only use macros if something cannot be done without using them. Usually macros
  can be replaced with constexpr or const variables or function calls. A case
  where macros are the only way is for BOOST_LEAF_CHECK() since there is no way
  to automatically generate the boiler plate for returning if a function returns
  and error in C++ and thus a macro is needed here to prevent possible mistakes
  in writing out the boilerplate.
- Only use preprocessor `#if` and the like if it is impossible to use
  `if constexpr` to achieve the same behavior.
- Never include `<iostream>` as it incurs an automatic 150kB space penalty even
  if the application never uses any part of `<iostream>`.
- Drivers should refrain from memory allocate as much as possible that includes
  using STL libraries that allocate such as `std::string` or `std::vector`.
- Logging within a library is prohibited for two reasons:
  - String formatting libraries may not be the same across libraries and an
    application including both will have to pay the space cost for two separate
    formatting libraries.
  - libembeddedhal libraries do not have the right to output to stdout/stderr,
    that is the role and responsibility of the application.
- Interfaces must follow the public API, private virtual method shown
  [here](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill18.htm).
- Inclusion of a C header file full of register map structures is not allowed as
  it would pollute the global namespace and tends to result in name collisions.

<summary> üìñ Guides </summary>
<hr/>

All guides follow the [C++ Core
Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).

<details>
<summary>Creating a new interface</summary>

Guidelines for interfaces:

1. Follow the private virtual api pattern which looks like this:
```C++
class interface
{
 public:
  /**
   * ... API behavior documentation goes here ...
   */
  [[nodiscard]] boost::leaf::result<void> do_something() {
    return driver_do_something();
  }
 private:
  virtual boost::leaf::result<void> driver_do_something() = 0;
};
```
2. Outside of rule #1, do not include any non-virtual member functions in the
   interface.
3. For configuration data for which the bounds are not defined and are invariant
   the actual API use a configure function with this signature
   `boost::leaf::result<void> configure(const settings&)` where `settings` is an
   inner `struct` defined within the interface class's namespace. See
   `include/libembeddedhal/serial/serial.hpp` as an example already in use.
4. All members of a `settings` `struct` must be initialized with default values.
   These defaults should be values that most system can support.
5. All virtual member functions must have the following decorations:
    1. return types: `boost::leaf::result<T>` to order to allow error
       signaling to propagate, where T is the type you want to return.
    2. Marked as `noexcept`
    3. Marked as `[[nodsicard]]`

<summary>Implementing a Peripheral Driver (memory mapped I/O)</summary>

Follow along with the comments in the example C++ below to get an idea of how
to create a standard peripheral implementation. This is only meant for drivers
that use memory mapped I/O and do not require other drivers to operate. If
other device drivers are needed for your implementation, please
"Implementing a Device Driver".

Rules for peripheral driver implementations:

1. Keep the global namespace clean of any implementation details. This can be
   done by nesting all of the supporting code inside of the peripheral library's
   class. This includes memory maps, bit masks, const/constexpr values.
2. Do not depend on the data section being initialized when the constructor is
   executed. This means that non-zero initialized global variables are not
   allowed for drivers. This includes `static inline` variables nested within
   the class.
3. All drivers must be single phase initialized, meaning that that a driver must
   be usable after it has been constructed. Drivers should initialize any hard
   dependencies such as interrupt vector tables, or clock initializations should
   be done at this point in the code.
4. Expect that that the `.bss` section will be cleared to `0`
5. Expect that the order of constructors across compilation is effectively
   random.
